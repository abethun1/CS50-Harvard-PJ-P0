Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For the professor/instructor of CS 50  Python and Javascript:

Notes About Site : This is a mockup of a body building site. Itâ€™s purpose would be to teach someone about their different body type and give them a workout routine and meal plan in order for them to achieve specific goals. I understand that the main purpose of the project is to familiarize ourselves with the tools that we were shown and also to implement them in a way to show that we understand what we are using. This is why a lot of my site is just components of bootstrap that I tweaked and added on to to achieve the goals set forth in the instruction of this project. I really wanted to go more in depth but I am trying to finish at least 2 projects a week for this class so I kept it simple at certain points and did reuse many of the same images and direct lines from other websites, but I just wanted to give the site a certain look and feel and show its scalability. I hope that I hit the right points in showing my understanding of the lessons so far.

For those looking at this site for info :

This is just a quick mockup of an information giving website. The data here is mostly procured from the internet so please don't take it as fact without doing your own research. The main goal of this project for me was to show my ability to ustilize specific tools that I learned over a coupple of day to hack out something for a grade. With that being said, I am still proud of it and even though it is not super documented, using bootstrap4 should give you an understanding on the ease of building a website similar like this is a similar time frame that I built it in which was around 15 hours.
